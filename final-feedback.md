Overal comment: 
Features: Points taken off for not having the app deployed and ready to be demoed on Heroku. 

Testing: 

Other: Good job with branching; however, could do a better job with pull requests and issues/user story tracking. These are important 
to establishing a good dev workflow! Great job with documentation!

A few things can be improved but all in all, good job with the project!
